# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 17, 2017 - May 29, 2017

**Thoughts:** Most weekdays the #daily_programmer channel on the PhillyDev Slack will post programming challenges. This was/is a good way to keep using my programming skills.

### Day 1: May 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Getting a new repo setup for my second 100 Days of Code Challenge.

**Thoughts:** Going for a second repo that isn't a fork. This will help populate my contributions counter on Github. Gaming the system. Getting the repo setup for freeCodeCamp's Roguelike Dungeon Crawler.

### Day 2: May 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Getting a rough initialization of the dungeon. Daily programming challenges from the PhillyDev Slack.


**Thoughts:** Trying to stub out a basic dungeon. Run into a problem with Array().fill() when creating a 2D array. The fill only makes one array so any changes to a cell show up in every row.
Also React wants me to start using ES6 Classes to define my components. Not having much luck with that and back out those changes for todays commit.

Gave the daily programming challenge the usual old school and ES6 solutions. I wasn't able to really cut the code down to much with the Array methods. Attempts at just using Array methods seemed to head in the direction of O(n^2) so I stop going down that path.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress** Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
