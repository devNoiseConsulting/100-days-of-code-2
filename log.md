# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 17, 2017 - May 29, 2017

**Thoughts:** Most weekdays the #daily_programmer channel on the PhillyDev Slack will post programming challenges. This was/is a good way to keep using my programming skills.

### Day 1: May 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Getting a new repo setup for my second 100 Days of Code Challenge.

**Thoughts:** Going for a second repo that isn't a fork. This will help populate my contributions counter on Github. Gaming the system. Getting the repo setup for freeCodeCamp's Roguelike Dungeon Crawler.

### Day 2: May 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Getting a rough initialization of the dungeon. Daily programming challenges from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Trying to stub out a basic dungeon. Run into a problem with Array().fill() when creating a 2D array. The fill only makes one array so any changes to a cell show up in every row.
Also React wants me to start using ES6 Classes to define my components. Not having much luck with that and back out those changes for todays commit.

Gave the daily programming challenge the usual old school and ES6 solutions. I wasn't able to really cut the code down to much with the Array methods. Attempts at just using Array methods seemed to head in the direction of O(n^2) so I stop going down that path.

### Day 3: Jun 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Roguelike dungeon has movement and some improved rendering. Daily programming challenges from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Felt like the rendering was taking a bit since the initial code had the 10,000 dungeon cells being rendered. Move to having the dungeon row display all the cells, brings us down to 100 components to render. Put in a keypress handler to determine movement and update the dungeon. Once that seemed to work I added a check to make sure the cell was empty.

Daily programming challenge went well for the first solution. Had a couple iterations to get it right. Had to make checks against both the pattern and the string. Tried to get fancy and have my code generate regex expressions based on the pattern. It worked in general, but failed one of the test cases. Ran out of time to work on it, but the solution seems to be added another check that compares the length of the unique elements in the two arrays.

### Day 4: Jun 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Roguelike dungeon has treasure and monsters. Daily programming challenges from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Added a some CSS so the dungeon's font size would be smaller to fit more onto the screen, Refactored the dungeon initialization to break out the parts into their own function to help keep the code clear. Also changed the values in the cells from being a character to being an object. This allows me to have a better handle on the state of things in the dungeon.

Only went with one solution for the Daily programming challenge. Made use of Array.reduce() to store the duplicates. Array.reduce() is getting to be a familiar tool. The Array.indexOf() was the one had me using a feature rarely used by me. Passed in an offset argument so the Array.indexOf() would ignore the first instance of the occurrence.

### Day 5: Jun 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Roguelike dungeon has treasure collection and monster fighting.

**Thoughts:** Making progress. Added the code to collect the treasure and add health back to the player. Player will now attack monsters and take their weapon when defeated. Used react-bootstrap to clean up the UI. Also added a function to determine if a dungeon cell was visible from the player's current position.

### Day 6: Jun 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Roguelike dungeon has multiple levels now.

**Thoughts:** Reworking the code to handle the generation of a new level when the player enters the ladder cell. Getting an off by one bug for the dungeon level in the state object. Must be a race condition as my code is executing before the state is updated. Updating the user's level doesn't seem to be working, will look into that tomorrow.

### Day 7: Jun 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixing game logic for Roguelike dungeon. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Fix Level bug because I was doing an exact comparison when I should have been doing a greater than comparison. Added code to make sure the player's health doesn’t go above 100. Added a dungeonWon state that will indicate the player has won and display all of the dungeon level.

I passed all the test cases for the daily programming challenge, but I think I missing some use cases. I believe my code is only returning results for a subsequence of 3. I should have handled cases that are larger.

### Day 8: Jun 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixing game state for Roguelike dungeon. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Working on getting the Reset/New Game and Continue buttons to work. Booleans are not strings and that screwed up disabling the Continue button. The React component's state is not your friend when you're trying to it to calculate based off of intermediate values. I ended up reworking how the dungeon is initialized so that state is accessed as little as possible. This means I refactored a bit of the hacks I put in and instead just passed in what I considered to be the current state for the sub functions.

I love working with array. So I made everything in the daily programming challenge into an array to solve the problem. This allowed me to make the prefixes pretty easy. I'm sure that the solution would be pretty much the same if I had used String.substring().

### Day 9: Jun 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Figuring out my React render problem for the Roguelike dungeon. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** The UI for my Rouguelike game is still text based. Though I have finally figured out how to get my array rendered. Previously, React wouldn't like the code I put into the render function or it turned the code into a string and wasn't valid HTML. Not sure why I thought I needed to use Array.join() to get the JSX/HTML.

I cribbed my daily programming solution from the Game of Life project I did for freeCodeCamp. Since I only had to write the function to calculate the cell life given the parameters. This allowed me to simplify how I got the total number of living neighbors. I did this using Array.reduce, but could have done it using Array.filter.

### Day 10: Jun 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Gave the Roguelike dungeon a graphical dungeon. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Probably not using as much Sass as I should be, but keeping the UI pretty basic. Almost as much play testing as coding tonight. Decided that I need to be able to distinguish between the regular monsters and the boss monster. Mostly just minor changes to the code to get the pixel cells to work, and then handling the boss display.

The daily programming challenge was pretty easy today. Made use of the ES6 spread operator because of how the problem was worded. The function was to take an unlimited number of parameters. The split was that the first parameter was the offset and the other parameters could just go into an array. Made a revised solution after seeing another solution. It made me realize that a simple change would allow me to access the value I needed with the use of String.substring().

### Day 11: Jun 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Not much. Started working on random generation of the rooms for the Roguelike dungeon. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** A little bit of refactoring. Wanted to put all of the dungeon cell definitions all together. Started work on the generating rooms with the initializeRooms function. Not liking the direction I took and research into how to implementations are leading towards a binary tree setup.

Had to refresh my memory for the daily programming challenge. I generally don't do user input in my node.js code. Made use of the ES6 string template, which is much nicer than the usual piece a string together with the desired variable.

### Day 12: Jun 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Refactoring the game logic for the Roguelike dungeon.

**Thoughts:** Avoiding the room generation today and went with refactoring. Started with moving all the dungeon creation to the DungeonFactory. That was straight forward with the changes I did the other day. Next I move into making the game play function work with the currentState. This took a couple iterations as I tried to avoid breaking the game as much as possible. This lead to pulling data out of currentState as well a putting data back in. Then I worked on having the game play function return the currentState variable. At which point they could be moved into the DungeonFactory.

### Day 13: Jun 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Starting random room generation for Roguelike dungeon.

**Thoughts:** Looking into BSP trees for creating the rooms for the dungeon. Started an implementation that seems good so far. Going forward, I need to think about how to calculate the placement of the door between rooms. At that point, I should be ready to draw the walls.

The daily programming challenge was a simple guess the number game. Had to review how I get node to do input via the readline module.

### Day 14: Jun 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I finished my Roguelike Dungeon Crawler! Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** This project seems to complicated to develop in CodePen, so I developed it on my laptop in a simple react/webpack project. The UI is very simple with bootstrap and some colored span/pixels. It took time to get everything done, but I really had to do a deep dive into figuring out how to generate the dungeon rooms. Found some articles on BSP trees to create a map. Wrote my own tree class based off of the sample code I saw. I decided to keep the room full sized and have door ways instead of rooms that fit in the rectangle with connecting hallways.

While I'm calling it done, there are 2 things I may come back to:

-   React.createClass is being depreciated. I need to go back and convert my components into ES6 classes.
-   It would be nice to make the dungeon larger. That would require me to splice the dungeon area down to a visible area that would be rendered.

The daily programming challenge was similar to yesterdays, but you had to guess the name. Had to tweak the logic to help the user guess again.

### Day 15: Jun 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixing door placement and starting component to class conversion for the Roguelike Dungeon Crawler. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Adding some randomization to the door placement so there is some variation moving between rooms. My orientation is a little off, had some errors where we went outside the dungeon bounds. Also started to work on getting the React components converted over to ES6 classes us jscodeshift. Trying to avoid pulling in the create-react-class module. Not sure if I'm running into a babel config setting, but it didn't like most of the converted classes. Removed the arrow function with plain functions and just commented out the empty state object.

The daily programming challenge was a straight forward task using regex. Even made a bash one liner for it.

### Day 16: Jun 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Codecademy code challenge. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Using my Javascript skills to get the Codecademy challenge done. Using reduce to get the products. Had to remember to try pairs of negative numbers to get the maximum product.

The PhillyDev daily programming challenge had you pad the words with 'x' to be the same length as the longest word. Also had to switch the first 'x' with a 'z' if the last letter of the word was 'x'.

### Day 17: Jun 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** The simple programming challenge dragged me down a rabbit hole today. Basically repeat the challenge from yesterday, but transpose the word block. I took the quick way out and found an [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36164530) on Stack Overflow for how to transpose a 2d array. I get how to transpose a matrix array and could have written my own code. Took the easy way out as I wanted the challenge done so I could do some analog stuff today with my son. When I get back to looking at my code, I want to understand exactly what the code I copied it doing. The code is getting expanded/converted so I can debug how the transpose is working.

### Day 18: Jun 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** The daily programming theme this week seemed to be 2D arrays or matrix structures. Today's challenge was to take a list of words and make a word find. Got some [notes](http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/creating-word-find-pzzules-in-C-Sharp-and-gdi/) for a C# implementation. This gave me the foundation for the work I needed to do in Javascript, but I still needed to come up with the lower level functionality. When I called the placeWord function, I needed to make sure I made a copy to the sub-array otherwise I end up trashing the word find. Lots of debugging/testing to get this to work.

### Day 19: Jun 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** No progress, but trying to convert React Component to ES6 class.

**Thoughts:** Trying to follow a couple articles on how to convert a React Component to an ES6 class. For some reason `state = {...};` ends up giving a `Module build failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token` error. Now sure what is causing this and trying searching for a solution. Through it might get solves by adding es2015 presets to babel.

### Day 20: Jun 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** No more warnings from React for the Roguelike Dungeon Crawler! Also getting the Github repo setup for the Voting Booth.

**Thoughts:** Found Nathan Smith's [SlideShare](https://www.tandemseven.com/technology/how-to-get-started-with-react-slideshare/) which lead me to his [React Starter](https://github.com/t7/react-starter). Found a component that had a default/initial state. His method was to have a function that set the state and call it from a constructor. This seemed to differ from the way that jscodeshift and react-codmod converted my code. My implementation followed, but also had the function return the state as I had code that wanted a copy of the initial state before setting the state.

Also started getting a repo setup to create a React app for the Voting App project. Haven't tried to setup a starter shell repo, but copy the packages I installed on the Roguelike Dungeon Crawler and some of the config files.

### Day 21: Jun 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Working on a portfolio page for my freeCodeCamp projects. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Started playing around with Bootstrap v4. Need to get something in place for freecodecamp.devnose.com where I've hosted a couple of the projects I thought were to big for CodePen. Focusing on using the card component. Still need to figure out how to size and place them on the page.

The daily programming challenge had me creating a store of peoples time in an office. Created class for the workers and office schedule. Created a toString function to create the required output.

### Day 22: Jun 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** More work on a portfolio page for my freeCodeCamp projects. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** More work on the portfolio page with Bootstrap cards. Having issues getting a resizable width.

The daily programming challenge built off of the previous challenge. Determined when to have a meeting that all coworkers could attend.

### Day 23: Jun 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Took my son to Phill.net's meetup to learn Scratch. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Since my son has expressed some interest in what I'm programming, I decided to take hime to a meetup that was focused on coding for kids. He was able to customize the basic example and came up with another project. His desire to customize his 2nd project exceeded the introduction he got to Scratch. When we got home I worked him through some pseudocode that would get the project to work like he wants.

The daily programming challenge continues the office theme. The input now features the workers preferred meeting time. Made another pass through the available meeting times and added a bonus to the worker's preferred meeting times.

### Day 24: Jun 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Grid layout on the portfolio page for my freeCodeCamp projects. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Took a peak at some examples on [Bootsnipp](https://bootsnipp.com/) to see how other people are working with card in Bootstrap v4. Seems like the grid layout is the way to go. Using the different break points to resize the cards. Also dropped the card-link class in favor of buttons for the links. Didn't like how the links were displaying when I had a link to the project and th github repo.

The daily programming challenge continues the office theme. The tweak today was to allow some workers to be optional for a meeting. So now the coworker class has mustAttend property. When marking the best time, optional workers have their weighted preferences recorded at 1x and required workers at 3x. While my code works, I returned a different result as my weighted preference calculation affected the choice.

### Day 25: Jun 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fighting with screen shots for the portfolio page. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Wanted to make the Bootstrap v4 card fancy and include an image. Trying to use Firefox's built in screenshot from the developer toolbar. My problem with the screenshots is that CodePen puts the rendered version in an iFrame. I'm trying to make a full page screenshot with the real content in the iframe. Firefox thinks it has the full page, but is truncating the screenshot.

The daily programming challenge continues the office theme. Had to rewrite the schedule creation to accept input from the command line. Made use of the readline module. Snagged a code sample from a previous challenge I completed. Put the different prompts in an array and loop over them. Only issue was that rl.close() didn't seem to stop the program from asking for input. Ended up with a process.exit() to terminate the execution.

### Day 26: Jun 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Adding screenshots to the Bootstrap v4 cards.

**Thoughts:** Finished making all the screenshots that I could. Using some Imagemagick tools to resize, crop and pad the screenshots into a usable size for the cards. Had to do a some searches to find the command and options I needed to get the image as I wanted.

### Day 27: Jun 25, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Not much. Trying to get a handle on requirements.

**Thoughts:** [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) seems like the option to use for authentication. Need to get a better handle on the authentication. I think the auth part is putting up a big road block for me. Feel like I have to many moving pieces right now.

### Day 28: Jun 26, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Bowling score calculators are tricky. I've gone bowling enough that I can score a frame, but putting that into code isn't easy. The input is an array of strings that represent the frame. Started by converting the each frame from a string to an array via split(). Strikes are represented by an 'X' so I mapped all those to a value of 10. Next I converted the spares into integer values. The '/' was converted into 10 minus the value of the first throw. At that point the code put in the values needed to calculate strikes and spares. This allowed sum/reduce the values in the frame with another sum/reduce on all the frames.

### Day 29: Jun 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Trying to get an old project running again. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** I can't stand using CodePen for semi-complex projects. Trying to figure out how I can use the Twitch Pass Through API with the fetch API. I told it not to worry about CORS with the mode set to `no-cors` and end up with a response that has status = 0 and no data. Remove the mode option and get a warning about preflight. Made a post for help on the freeCodeCamp forum.

The daily programming has us validating a football score. I came up with a plow through it sort of solution. Minor tweaks but following the original intent to solve the problem. The interesting part was someone else's solution used Array.some() to solve the problem. I had never used that helper function before and had to research it some. Array.some() will return true if any of the values in the array returns a true.

### Day 30: Jun 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack. Stalled looking for React tutorials

**Thoughts:** The daily programming has us accept a string of letters and then display the state of a Scrabble tile bag. Instead of just typing in an object with the initial bag state, I made it a string and parsed it into an object. The typeof call didn't help me when I need to know if I have an object or an array. Use `bag.constructor === Array` instead.

Trying to figure out if I need state (ie redux) or a router to make my react apps to more functional.

### Day 31: Jun 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** I think my brain melted/broke when I saw this problem. We had to write a program that would solve [Countdown's number round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)#Numbers_round). From the description I knew it was going to be some sort of recursive search algorithm type problem. While I can handle this kind of code, it's not a typical programming challenge that some time on before I start my day. Drawing a blank on the solution, I did a search to see what some solutions were. Found a couple in Ruby, Java and Python. All doing some stuff I couldn't completely follow. But the general gist of the solutions is take a number out of the array and then call the worker function. The worker function will take a number out of the array and try to add, subtract, multiply and divide the original value. I then throw this back into the worker function. If the number we send in isn't an integer or negative then this path is bad and stop working. Other the code keeps going until the array no longer has any values in it. At this point we see if the number matches the target.

Since I'm writing this in Javascript, I made use of the .forEach() function. I can't break out of this function, so I keep track if a solution is found. If so then don't do work on the remaining iterations.

### Day 32: Jun 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack. Started some Redux videos on Egghead.io

**Thoughts:** The daily programming challenge ended up being a striped down version of yesterday's solution. Instead of calling the worker function, I did work inside the main function. Generally just create a sub array that excludes the current value the code is iterating over. Iterate over the sub array and see the sum equals the target. One suggested solution was to subtract the iterating value from the target and see is the sub array contains the difference. It's probably still O(n^2), but from my code the appears to be O(n).

Started watching some videos on Egghead.io based off of a response to one of my #100DaysOfCode tweets. It looks like it makes sense, but I still get the feeling that I'm gonna need a router for the react app to complete the Voting App project. Makes me wonder if I should jump back to an Angular app with the CLI or do I start looking for a React CLI?

### Day 33: Jul 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack. Some more React research.

**Thoughts:** Felt the description for the daily programming challenge was a little vague, The example pseudocode made it look like your were passing in recipe object to get the ingredients. If you have the recipe object you have the ingredients. You were suppose to create a class/structure for a recipe that has a name and an array of ingredients. After that I made a recipe box class to hold the recipes. The getIngredient function would take in the recipe name as an argument, At that point you find the recipe with the matching name and output the list of ingredients.

It looks like `create-react-app` is the best cli tool for creating ReactJS apps.

### Day 34: Jul 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Let's start off with variable naming is always important. Am I using the ingredients variable that is a map or the ingredients variable that is an array? If you have a simple setter function keeping them the same is okay. If you need to do work with both of them, you can get confused and bad things happen.

Made us of the Map object to store the ingredients in the Panty object. It was useful to help create a clean implementation. I could have gone with a plain object to hold the ingredients. Though I would have been using hasOwnProperty() and probably coding more checks to keep everything straight.

### Day 35: Jul 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** More Maps in my data structures today. Needed to allow for ingredient substitutions. I keep the substitutions in the recipe box class instead of on the recipe class. The Map portion worked without much issue. The big part was to remember to make a copy of the ingredients array. While my code was working, I realized that I displayed the substituted ingredient without passing it back. Array references! I was making change on the original array and that would corrupt the ingredient for any future use. So made some tweaks with a copy of the array and made sure to pass back the used ingredients for the output.

### Day 36: Jul 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Working with the React-Router

**Thoughts:** Started working through a [scotch.io tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-mini-netflix-with-react-in-10-minutes). This is helping me work with the create-react-app tool. Since this is Javascript, libraries and frameworks are always out of date. So while cutting and pasting some code in, I'm also trying to update the code. This means migrating from React-Router v3 to v4. browserHistory now seems to be BrowserRouter. I seemed to have some issue with the component rendering. Initially, it would draw the default component as well as the selected component. Looks like I needed to use the Switch component. That would only render the default component until I added the exact attribute to the Route component. That's all I had time for before I put into a Github repo to have some proof of work for the log.
