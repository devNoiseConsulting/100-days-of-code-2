# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 17, 2017 - May 29, 2017

**Thoughts:** Most weekdays the #daily_programmer channel on the PhillyDev Slack will post programming challenges. This was/is a good way to keep using my programming skills.

### Day 1: May 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Getting a new repo setup for my second 100 Days of Code Challenge.

**Thoughts:** Going for a second repo that isn't a fork. This will help populate my contributions counter on Github. Gaming the system. Getting the repo setup for freeCodeCamp's Roguelike Dungeon Crawler.

### Day 2: May 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Getting a rough initialization of the dungeon. Daily programming challenges from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Trying to stub out a basic dungeon. Run into a problem with Array().fill() when creating a 2D array. The fill only makes one array so any changes to a cell show up in every row.
Also React wants me to start using ES6 Classes to define my components. Not having much luck with that and back out those changes for todays commit.

Gave the daily programming challenge the usual old school and ES6 solutions. I wasn't able to really cut the code down to much with the Array methods. Attempts at just using Array methods seemed to head in the direction of O(n^2) so I stop going down that path.

### Day 3: Jun 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Roguelike dungeon has movement and some improved rendering. Daily programming challenges from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Felt like the rendering was taking a bit since the initial code had the 10,000 dungeon cells being rendered. Move to having the dungeon row display all the cells, brings us down to 100 components to render. Put in a keypress handler to determine movement and update the dungeon. Once that seemed to work I added a check to make sure the cell was empty.

Daily programming challenge went well for the first solution. Had a couple iterations to get it right. Had to make checks against both the pattern and the string. Tried to get fancy and have my code generate regex expressions based on the pattern. It worked in general, but failed one of the test cases. Ran out of time to work on it, but the solution seems to be added another check that compares the length of the unique elements in the two arrays.

### Day 4: Jun 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Roguelike dungeon has treasure and monsters. Daily programming challenges from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Added a some CSS so the dungeon's font size would be smaller to fit more onto the screen, Refactored the dungeon initialization to break out the parts into their own function to help keep the code clear. Also changed the values in the cells from being a character to being an object. This allows me to have a better handle on the state of things in the dungeon.

Only went with one solution for the Daily programming challenge. Made use of Array.reduce() to store the duplicates. Array.reduce() is getting to be a familiar tool. The Array.indexOf() was the one had me using a feature rarely used by me. Passed in an offset argument so the Array.indexOf() would ignore the first instance of the occurrence.

### Day 5: Jun 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Roguelike dungeon has treasure collection and monster fighting.

**Thoughts:** Making progress. Added the code to collect the treasure and add health back to the player. Player will now attack monsters and take their weapon when defeated. Used react-bootstrap to clean up the UI. Also added a function to determine if a dungeon cell was visible from the player's current position.

### Day 6: Jun 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Roguelike dungeon has multiple levels now.

**Thoughts:** Reworking the code to handle the generation of a new level when the player enters the ladder cell. Getting an off by one bug for the dungeon level in the state object. Must be a race condition as my code is executing before the state is updated. Updating the user's level doesn't seem to be working, will look into that tomorrow.

### Day 7: Jun 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixing game logic for Roguelike dungeon. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Fix Level bug because I was doing an exact comparison when I should have been doing a greater than comparison. Added code to make sure the player's health doesn’t go above 100. Added a dungeonWon state that will indicate the player has won and display all of the dungeon level.

I passed all the test cases for the daily programming challenge, but I think I missing some use cases. I believe my code is only returning results for a subsequence of 3. I should have handled cases that are larger.

### Day 8: Jun 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixing game state for Roguelike dungeon. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Working on getting the Reset/New Game and Continue buttons to work. Booleans are not strings and that screwed up disabling the Continue button. The React component's state is not your friend when you're trying to it to calculate based off of intermediate values. I ended up reworking how the dungeon is initialized so that state is accessed as little as possible. This means I refactored a bit of the hacks I put in and instead just passed in what I considered to be the current state for the sub functions.

I love working with array. So I made everything in the daily programming challenge into an array to solve the problem. This allowed me to make the prefixes pretty easy. I'm sure that the solution would be pretty much the same if I had used String.substring().

### Day 9: Jun 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Figuring out my React render problem for the Roguelike dungeon. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** The UI for my Rouguelike game is still text based. Though I have finally figured out how to get my array rendered. Previously, React wouldn't like the code I put into the render function or it turned the code into a string and wasn't valid HTML. Not sure why I thought I needed to use Array.join() to get the JSX/HTML.

I cribbed my daily programming solution from the Game of Life project I did for freeCodeCamp. Since I only had to write the function to calculate the cell life given the parameters. This allowed me to simplify how I got the total number of living neighbors. I did this using Array.reduce, but could have done it using Array.filter.

### Day 10: Jun 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Gave the Roguelike dungeon a graphical dungeon. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Probably not using as much Sass as I should be, but keeping the UI pretty basic. Almost as much play testing as coding tonight. Decided that I need to be able to distinguish between the regular monsters and the boss monster. Mostly just minor changes to the code to get the pixel cells to work, and then handling the boss display.

The daily programming challenge was pretty easy today. Made use of the ES6 spread operator because of how the problem was worded. The function was to take an unlimited number of parameters. The split was that the first parameter was the offset and the other parameters could just go into an array. Made a revised solution after seeing another solution. It made me realize that a simple change would allow me to access the value I needed with the use of String.substring().

### Day 11: Jun 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Not much. Started working on random generation of the rooms for the Roguelike dungeon. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** A little bit of refactoring. Wanted to put all of the dungeon cell definitions all together. Started work on the generating rooms with the initializeRooms function. Not liking the direction I took and research into how to implementations are leading towards a binary tree setup.

Had to refresh my memory for the daily programming challenge. I generally don't do user input in my node.js code. Made use of the ES6 string template, which is much nicer than the usual piece a string together with the desired variable.

### Day 12: Jun 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Refactoring the game logic for the Roguelike dungeon.

**Thoughts:** Avoiding the room generation today and went with refactoring. Started with moving all the dungeon creation to the DungeonFactory. That was straight forward with the changes I did the other day. Next I move into making the game play function work with the currentState. This took a couple iterations as I tried to avoid breaking the game as much as possible. This lead to pulling data out of currentState as well a putting data back in. Then I worked on having the game play function return the currentState variable. At which point they could be moved into the DungeonFactory.

### Day 13: Jun 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Starting random room generation for Roguelike dungeon.

**Thoughts:** Looking into BSP trees for creating the rooms for the dungeon. Started an implementation that seems good so far. Going forward, I need to think about how to calculate the placement of the door between rooms. At that point, I should be ready to draw the walls.

The daily programming challenge was a simple guess the number game. Had to review how I get node to do input via the readline module.

### Day 14: Jun 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I finished my Roguelike Dungeon Crawler! Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** This project seems to complicated to develop in CodePen, so I developed it on my laptop in a simple react/webpack project. The UI is very simple with bootstrap and some colored span/pixels. It took time to get everything done, but I really had to do a deep dive into figuring out how to generate the dungeon rooms. Found some articles on BSP trees to create a map. Wrote my own tree class based off of the sample code I saw. I decided to keep the room full sized and have door ways instead of rooms that fit in the rectangle with connecting hallways.

While I'm calling it done, there are 2 things I may come back to:

-   React.createClass is being depreciated. I need to go back and convert my components into ES6 classes.
-   It would be nice to make the dungeon larger. That would require me to splice the dungeon area down to a visible area that would be rendered.

The daily programming challenge was similar to yesterdays, but you had to guess the name. Had to tweak the logic to help the user guess again.

### Day 15: Jun 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixing door placement and starting component to class conversion for the Roguelike Dungeon Crawler. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Adding some randomization to the door placement so there is some variation moving between rooms. My orientation is a little off, had some errors where we went outside the dungeon bounds. Also started to work on getting the React components converted over to ES6 classes us jscodeshift. Trying to avoid pulling in the create-react-class module. Not sure if I'm running into a babel config setting, but it didn't like most of the converted classes. Removed the arrow function with plain functions and just commented out the empty state object.

The daily programming challenge was a straight forward task using regex. Even made a bash one liner for it.

### Day 16: Jun 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Codecademy code challenge. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Using my Javascript skills to get the Codecademy challenge done. Using reduce to get the products. Had to remember to try pairs of negative numbers to get the maximum product.

The PhillyDev daily programming challenge had you pad the words with 'x' to be the same length as the longest word. Also had to switch the first 'x' with a 'z' if the last letter of the word was 'x'.

### Day 17: Jun 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** The simple programming challenge dragged me down a rabbit hole today. Basically repeat the challenge from yesterday, but transpose the word block. I took the quick way out and found an [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36164530) on Stack Overflow for how to transpose a 2d array. I get how to transpose a matrix array and could have written my own code. Took the easy way out as I wanted the challenge done so I could do some analog stuff today with my son. When I get back to looking at my code, I want to understand exactly what the code I copied it doing. The code is getting expanded/converted so I can debug how the transpose is working.

### Day 18: Jun 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** The daily programming theme this week seemed to be 2D arrays or matrix structures. Today's challenge was to take a list of words and make a word find. Got some [notes](http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/creating-word-find-pzzules-in-C-Sharp-and-gdi/) for a C# implementation. This gave me the foundation for the work I needed to do in Javascript, but I still needed to come up with the lower level functionality. When I called the placeWord function, I needed to make sure I made a copy to the sub-array otherwise I end up trashing the word find. Lots of debugging/testing to get this to work.

### Day 19: Jun 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** No progress, but trying to convert React Component to ES6 class.

**Thoughts:** Trying to follow a couple articles on how to convert a React Component to an ES6 class. For some reason `state = {...};` ends up giving a `Module build failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token` error. Now sure what is causing this and trying searching for a solution. Through it might get solves by adding es2015 presets to babel.

### Day 20: Jun 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** No more warnings from React for the Roguelike Dungeon Crawler! Also getting the Github repo setup for the Voting Booth.

**Thoughts:** Found Nathan Smith's [SlideShare](https://www.tandemseven.com/technology/how-to-get-started-with-react-slideshare/) which lead me to his [React Starter](https://github.com/t7/react-starter). Found a component that had a default/initial state. His method was to have a function that set the state and call it from a constructor. This seemed to differ from the way that jscodeshift and react-codmod converted my code. My implementation followed, but also had the function return the state as I had code that wanted a copy of the initial state before setting the state.

Also started getting a repo setup to create a React app for the Voting App project. Haven't tried to setup a starter shell repo, but copy the packages I installed on the Roguelike Dungeon Crawler and some of the config files.

### Day 21: Jun 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Working on a portfolio page for my freeCodeCamp projects. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Started playing around with Bootstrap v4. Need to get something in place for freecodecamp.devnose.com where I've hosted a couple of the projects I thought were to big for CodePen. Focusing on using the card component. Still need to figure out how to size and place them on the page.

The daily programming challenge had me creating a store of peoples time in an office. Created class for the workers and office schedule. Created a toString function to create the required output.

### Day 22: Jun 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** More work on a portfolio page for my freeCodeCamp projects. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** More work on the portfolio page with Bootstrap cards. Having issues getting a resizable width.

The daily programming challenge built off of the previous challenge. Determined when to have a meeting that all coworkers could attend.

### Day 23: Jun 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Took my son to Phill.net's meetup to learn Scratch. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Since my son has expressed some interest in what I'm programming, I decided to take hime to a meetup that was focused on coding for kids. He was able to customize the basic example and came up with another project. His desire to customize his 2nd project exceeded the introduction he got to Scratch. When we got home I worked him through some pseudocode that would get the project to work like he wants.

The daily programming challenge continues the office theme. The input now features the workers preferred meeting time. Made another pass through the available meeting times and added a bonus to the worker's preferred meeting times.

### Day 24: Jun 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Grid layout on the portfolio page for my freeCodeCamp projects. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Took a peak at some examples on [Bootsnipp](https://bootsnipp.com/) to see how other people are working with card in Bootstrap v4. Seems like the grid layout is the way to go. Using the different break points to resize the cards. Also dropped the card-link class in favor of buttons for the links. Didn't like how the links were displaying when I had a link to the project and th github repo.

The daily programming challenge continues the office theme. The tweak today was to allow some workers to be optional for a meeting. So now the coworker class has mustAttend property. When marking the best time, optional workers have their weighted preferences recorded at 1x and required workers at 3x. While my code works, I returned a different result as my weighted preference calculation affected the choice.

### Day 25: Jun 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fighting with screen shots for the portfolio page. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Wanted to make the Bootstrap v4 card fancy and include an image. Trying to use Firefox's built in screenshot from the developer toolbar. My problem with the screenshots is that CodePen puts the rendered version in an iFrame. I'm trying to make a full page screenshot with the real content in the iframe. Firefox thinks it has the full page, but is truncating the screenshot.

The daily programming challenge continues the office theme. Had to rewrite the schedule creation to accept input from the command line. Made use of the readline module. Snagged a code sample from a previous challenge I completed. Put the different prompts in an array and loop over them. Only issue was that rl.close() didn't seem to stop the program from asking for input. Ended up with a process.exit() to terminate the execution.

### Day 26: Jun 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Adding screenshots to the Bootstrap v4 cards.

**Thoughts:** Finished making all the screenshots that I could. Using some Imagemagick tools to resize, crop and pad the screenshots into a usable size for the cards. Had to do a some searches to find the command and options I needed to get the image as I wanted.

**Today's Progress:** Not much. Trying to get a handle on requirements.

**Thoughts:** [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) seems like the option to use for authentication. Need to get a better handle on the authentication. I think the auth part is putting up a big road block for me. Feel like I have to many moving pieces right now.

### Day 28: Jun 26, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Bowling score calculators are tricky. I've gone bowling enough that I can score a frame, but putting that into code isn't easy. The input is an array of strings that represent the frame. Started by converting the each frame from a string to an array via split(). Strikes are represented by an 'X' so I mapped all those to a value of 10. Next I converted the spares into integer values. The '/' was converted into 10 minus the value of the first throw. At that point the code put in the values needed to calculate strikes and spares. This allowed sum/reduce the values in the frame with another sum/reduce on all the frames.

### Day 29: Jun 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Trying to get an old project running again. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** I can't stand using CodePen for semi-complex projects. Trying to figure out how I can use the Twitch Pass Through API with the fetch API. I told it not to worry about CORS with the mode set to `no-cors` and end up with a response that has status = 0 and no data. Remove the mode option and get a warning about preflight. Made a post for help on the freeCodeCamp forum.

The daily programming has us validating a football score. I came up with a plow through it sort of solution. Minor tweaks but following the original intent to solve the problem. The interesting part was someone else's solution used Array.some() to solve the problem. I had never used that helper function before and had to research it some. Array.some() will return true if any of the values in the array returns a true.

### Day 30: Jun 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack. Stalled looking for React tutorials

**Thoughts:** The daily programming has us accept a string of letters and then display the state of a Scrabble tile bag. Instead of just typing in an object with the initial bag state, I made it a string and parsed it into an object. The typeof call didn't help me when I need to know if I have an object or an array. Use `bag.constructor === Array` instead.

Trying to figure out if I need state (ie redux) or a router to make my react apps to more functional.

### Day 31: Jun 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** I think my brain melted/broke when I saw this problem. We had to write a program that would solve [Countdown's number round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)#Numbers_round). From the description I knew it was going to be some sort of recursive search algorithm type problem. While I can handle this kind of code, it's not a typical programming challenge that some time on before I start my day. Drawing a blank on the solution, I did a search to see what some solutions were. Found a couple in Ruby, Java and Python. All doing some stuff I couldn't completely follow. But the general gist of the solutions is take a number out of the array and then call the worker function. The worker function will take a number out of the array and try to add, subtract, multiply and divide the original value. I then throw this back into the worker function. If the number we send in isn't an integer or negative then this path is bad and stop working. Other the code keeps going until the array no longer has any values in it. At this point we see if the number matches the target.

Since I'm writing this in Javascript, I made use of the .forEach() function. I can't break out of this function, so I keep track if a solution is found. If so then don't do work on the remaining iterations.

### Day 32: Jun 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack. Started some Redux videos on Egghead.io

**Thoughts:** The daily programming challenge ended up being a striped down version of yesterday's solution. Instead of calling the worker function, I did work inside the main function. Generally just create a sub array that excludes the current value the code is iterating over. Iterate over the sub array and see the sum equals the target. One suggested solution was to subtract the iterating value from the target and see is the sub array contains the difference. It's probably still O(n^2), but from my code the appears to be O(n).

Started watching some videos on Egghead.io based off of a response to one of my #100DaysOfCode tweets. It looks like it makes sense, but I still get the feeling that I'm gonna need a router for the react app to complete the Voting App project. Makes me wonder if I should jump back to an Angular app with the CLI or do I start looking for a React CLI?

### Day 33: Jul 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack. Some more React research.

**Thoughts:** Felt the description for the daily programming challenge was a little vague, The example pseudocode made it look like your were passing in recipe object to get the ingredients. If you have the recipe object you have the ingredients. You were suppose to create a class/structure for a recipe that has a name and an array of ingredients. After that I made a recipe box class to hold the recipes. The getIngredient function would take in the recipe name as an argument, At that point you find the recipe with the matching name and output the list of ingredients.

It looks like `create-react-app` is the best cli tool for creating ReactJS apps.

### Day 34: Jul 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Let's start off with variable naming is always important. Am I using the ingredients variable that is a map or the ingredients variable that is an array? If you have a simple setter function keeping them the same is okay. If you need to do work with both of them, you can get confused and bad things happen.

Made us of the Map object to store the ingredients in the Panty object. It was useful to help create a clean implementation. I could have gone with a plain object to hold the ingredients. Though I would have been using hasOwnProperty() and probably coding more checks to keep everything straight.

### Day 35: Jul 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** More Maps in my data structures today. Needed to allow for ingredient substitutions. I keep the substitutions in the recipe box class instead of on the recipe class. The Map portion worked without much issue. The big part was to remember to make a copy of the ingredients array. While my code was working, I realized that I displayed the substituted ingredient without passing it back. Array references! I was making change on the original array and that would corrupt the ingredient for any future use. So made some tweaks with a copy of the array and made sure to pass back the used ingredients for the output.

### Day 36: Jul 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Working with the React-Router

**Thoughts:** Started working through a [scotch.io tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-mini-netflix-with-react-in-10-minutes). This is helping me work with the create-react-app tool. Since this is Javascript, libraries and frameworks are always out of date. So while cutting and pasting some code in, I'm also trying to update the code. This means migrating from React-Router v3 to v4. browserHistory now seems to be BrowserRouter. I seemed to have some issue with the component rendering. Initially, it would draw the default component as well as the selected component. Looks like I needed to use the Switch component. That would only render the default component until I added the exact attribute to the Route component. That's all I had time for before I put into a Github repo to have some proof of work for the log.

**Today's Progress:**  Working with the React-Router

**Thoughts:** More work on the [scotch.io tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-mini-netflix-with-react-in-10-minutes). Maybe the React-router is pretty straight forward, but didn't get into many details today. Mostly got exposure to the Cloudinary Service. Always seem to hard code keys into the code and then commit them. I left them in the code, but then I deleted the keys from the Cloudinary dashboard.

### Day 38: Jul 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Worked on a vowel count on text input from readline. Really worked most of this memory. Tricky part is using .indexOf() inside .filter() you need to make a test and not rely on the result. "-1" is not false and everything got counted.

### Day 39: Jul 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack. Tweaking the myGeoBeerMap

**Thoughts:** Needed to find all sets of 3 numbers in an array that sum to zero. Pretty much went brute force on my approach. For each iteration, I would make a slice of the array that was comprised of the remaining elements. The real tricky part was trying return only the unique sets. First I sorted all elements to help reduce duplicates. Finally I saved the set into a Map variable so tht any duplicates would overwrite the old value. This way Map.values will return an iterator of my unique sets. Otherwise I probably have to implement a function that would compare 2 arrays. That seemed like to much overhead when the Map variable would handle it as I generated the sets.

Also updated how leaflet.js gets tiles from Mapbox. Dropped down the rabbit hole or testing out all the map styles I could use. Settled on 'high-contrast' as it stays pretty monochromatic, but gives more road details.

### Day 40: Jul 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** JS Map are my new hammer. Feel like I've been using them a lot in my daily programming challenges. First pass I made a Map variable for every text conversion I was making. After seeing some other solutions, I went back and made a single map that had all the number to text conversions.

An email late in the day from Heroku, made me review my freeCodeCamp projects that are deployed on the service. Due to a denial of service attack, they would like all apps moved to one of the latest Long Term Support versions of node. I ended up changing the node version from a specific version to an generic version that would allow Heroku to load the latest version. This made me brush up on some of the Heroku setup I did and figure out how to reload the app.

### Day 41, Jul 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** The daily programming challenge sucked up my coding spare time. The concept was to initialize a 2d array with values that populate in a spiral. Controlling the next location to initialize took a lot of thought. First pass was to try an monitor the array bound and change direction through a bunch of if statements. I could get a couple direction changes, but not all that were needed. I scrapped that approach and went with a new check. Now sure the row exists and the element is equal to 0. If so I write the value to the array or I back up to the previous element, update direction and increment. After my false start, this approach quickly came together.

### Day 42, Jul 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Trying to merge words together if the end of a word overlaps with the beginning of the next word. Wrote a function to take in two words and that made a bunch of .slice()s of the first word and check if the second word .startsWith() the fragment. If a match is found the merged word is returned. Then a .replace() is used to change the original string with the merged word.

### Day 43, Jul 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Trying to overcome Developaralysis for Voting App.

**Thoughts:** How should all of the stuff be handled? The front end is going to be a ReactJS app. The API/back end is going to be an express.js app with a MongoDB for storage. Are these deployed on two different Node.js instances or from the same instance? Confused about how a ReactJS SPA that most likely will use the React-router gets served from an Express.js server. Went the the freeCodeCamp forum to look for suggestions on how to tackle this project. Found an article named
[How to get "create-react-app" to work with your API](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server) that seems to cover how I should put this project together. Will try to get some code going tomorrow.

### Day 44, Jul 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Getting the Github repo setup for the Voting Booth. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Starting to get back into the voting app project. Using the advice from the article to restructure the code so that I have an express API and the react client in a single repo. Not much real code done, but have the servers setup running.

The daily programming challenge was the start of a theme of challenges for the week. Needed to initialize and display a game board. I grabbed the spiral array code from last week and started from there. Gutted a some stuff and worked on getting the code working.

### Day 45, Jul 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:**  Committed some doc change for the API. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much coding on the voting app as I would have liked. Mostly made changes to the README.md file to document what API calls I need to have. Mapping the calls to a route and HTTP request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

The daily programming challenge took yesterdays challenge and added boat placement. Took the code and moved it into a class. This required some minor changes to make it work. Since it seems like we're gonna have a couple different functions work on the game board it seemed like the right thing to do. Since I didn't feel like duplicating the game board array for the placement, I had 2 loops. One to check if the placement is valid and a second to do the operation. This saved me from having to back out the placement if it became invalid.

**Today's Progress:**  Getting connected to the MongoDB. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Getting the collection setup on the MongoDB instance. Putting code in place to setup the connection to MongoDB.

The daily programming challenge continued it's boat game theme. Took the existing code and made the needed changes. placeBoat will now accept either a letter or number for the x coord. This allowed me to just generate random numbers for the boat placement when create the opponent's board.

**Today's Progress:** Trying to generate IDs for the polls. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Working on Poll structure and how to generate an ID for the poll. Looking
into UUID v4 and then converting them to Base64.

Converting previous daily challenges into a board class. Then create a game class that instantiates 2 instances of the game board. Created a function to mark the guesses on the board. Worked on the create a redacted display of the game board so you can see your hits and misses, but not see your opponents placement.

### Day 48, Jul 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Not as much work as I would have liked, but did complete my daily challenge. So now we need to report when the ship is sunk. Instead of trying to scan the game board and try to figure out if anything is now sunk, I tracking it in a separate var. The game board now has a fleet which contains the boat type and size. The boat placement was modified to accept the boat's id. This way when a hit is made, we decrement the size of that ship. If we get to zero, then the message is sunk instead of a hit. To test this, I just made a while loop the would generated guess locations and fire away. Saw the sunk message as well as a lot of invalid moves. Assuming that we generated locations that had already been used.

### Day 49, Jul 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Challenge today was to convert XML into JSON. I initially tried to use regex to extract some logic out but quickly felt out of depth. A couple searches show some StackOverflow link that said Regex is not a parser and not good for XML. Drop back to using a library that would handle the parsing since Node.js doesn't seem to support the experimental DOMParser object. Since XML2JS's parseString used a callback I ended up saving the result to a global variable. Added some extra processing to make the JSON look closer to the example output. Generally, the resulting JSON was fine, it put string data inside an array. So I added some code to remove arrays with single elements. Figure I needed to write some code to match the example.

### Day 50, Jul 25, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** The challenge was to identify which of the six types are being used in a JSON object. Three of the six types will be identified as object. So then additional tests were needed to determine if we had an array or null type. To be complete I ended up call the function recursively, which lead to some problems. Object.keys() doesn't like when a null is passed in. Took a while to figure out which call was throwing the error.

### Day 51, Jul 26, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Codecademy Code Challenge and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** In an effort to defect from projects I should be working on I started Codecademy's code challenge. The challenge is to figure out the different ways you can make change form an ammount and available denominations. I came up with solutions that return correct answers, the problem is that I don't return enough answers. The first pass would eliminate a denomination and find answers. The second attempt used a map to know the maximum quantity for each denomination. As it was finding answers it would decrement the the quantity of the first denomination used. This got closer to the correct number of answers.

The daily programming challenge was pretty easy and straight forward. Just using JSON.stringify with arguments to make JSON pretty.

### Day 54, Aug 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Getting back into the voting app project and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Let's be honest. Login, authentication and authorization for the voting app project has me in a bit of developer paralysis. I'm not sure what to do and how to do it. While I didn't get much coding done for this project, I broke the paralysis. I'm ignoring integration with external auth providers (ie social media). I'm going to make a users collection and authenticate the users off of it. Progress should be made tomorrow.

The daily programming challenge was to take a number and rearrange the digits to make the next largest number. Crib a permutations solution from StackOverflow and started working on my solution. Once I had all the permutations, I needed to convert the subarrays into an integer. The following steps were to filter out all value less then the original number and a numeric sort of the remaining permutations. The first element should be the value desired.

### Day 55, Aug 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Getting back into the voting app project and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Procrastinating on project. Worked on app structure and trying to separate the login/signup routes to a separate file. Needed a refresher on how to use module.exports. For some reason I keep wanted to pluralize modules and then not do it for exports.

The daily programming challenge was to take a string and remove the excess parentheses. This is one of those I can look at it and give you the answer. When I need to code it, I have no idea what the steps are. So I went with regex for the solution. I did a String.replace() on the smallest piece of text in parentheses, stored it in an array and replaced it with a numbered token. I kept doing this until the string didn't change. Next I looked to see if any of the values I stored where a numbered token in parentheses, which were removed. Finally I started to replace the numbered tokens with the stored values.

### Day 56, Aug 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** More route stubs and JWT for the voting app project and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Added a couple more route stubs for the poll branch of the API. Also testing to see if I could put these routes on the same base url as the login routes. Started playing around with JWT to handle the auth on the poll API calls.

The daily programming challenge was to do the Threes game. Basically you mod 3 the number and see if you need to add or subtract 1 from the number before you divide it by 3. Decided to use recursion with a switch statement for the first solution. Since that was pretty straight forward, I created a second solution using a loop and ternary operators.

### Day 57, Aug 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Cookies and Mongoose for the Voting App and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Seems like cookie-parser is the preferred way to handle cookies in
express. Trying to figure out how I’m going to access mongo when I break stuff
out into a lot of separate files. Leads me to start using Mongoose.

Daily challenge was to test the if strings passed in are a pangram. Bonus was also to report the letter with the highest frequency. So convert to lowercase, strip out any non letters, split and increment array element for letter. Filter out any element with a value of 0. Is the array length still 26 then pangram. Run a reduce over the array to find highest frequency, by saving letter and ammount.

### Day 58, Aug 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** More Mongoose for the Voting App.

**Thoughts:** Trying to get the server to start now that Mongoose is the library to communicate with MongoDB. Of course everything is depreciated and have to keep searching for the changes that will make it work.

### Day 59, Aug 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Signup API call for the Voting App.

**Thoughts:** More Mongoose Schema work to create the User object. Scanned through a lot of blog posts/tutorials to find the code combination I needed. Added the body-parser package so I can read the data posted to the signup API call. Using the Postman app to test out the API call. Ran into some issues around how the data was posted to the API.

As usual, making changed to the code to avoid the depreciated warnings.

### Day 60, Aug 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Cookies Tokens for the Voting App and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Debugging issues that came up while trying to put a JWT inside a cookie. First issue was that I wasn't getting the JSON data from Postman. Turns out I had the wrong order for bodyParser middleware. JSON should be after the urlencoded. Second issue was that my tokens didn't have any data. Took me a while to see that the token was the same between signups. Turns out I was using the wrong object to populate the token.

The daily programming challenge was pretty straight forward. Initialize a 2D array and then iterate over the letters in the word passed in. In the iteration, I had 4 statements that would place a letter on each side of the box. A couple pass here to get all the sides right. A map and a join merged the array in a multiline string.

### Day XX, Aug 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Didn't really finish my hour of code for the day. I did work on the daily programming challenge which built on the challenge from Monday. So the challenge was to also take 2 numeric arguments that indicate the size of the box to print. Plan was to take multiple boxes and concat them together. Issues with that is the boxes had a shared side. So the additional boxes would have to have 1 or 2 sides removed before doing the concat.

### Day 61, Aug 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Login API and Cookies for the Voting App and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Worked on completing the login API call. Looked at a couple example articles/tutorials to figure out my methodology. Went with a promised base approach. Used a .findOne() call to get a User object to see if the correct password was given. Needed to tweak the User.comparePassword() so that it sends the user object to the callback function. This was needed so a JWT could include some of the user information. All of this was wrapped with checks to send back an error message if there were any issues.

The daily programming challenge was pretty straight forward. Working off the previous word boxes we needed to create a word triangle. Took a couple passes to get all of the side in the correct orientation. Once that was done, created a wrapper function which would determine if a box or triangle should be used.

### Day 62, Aug 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Adding some auth check code to the Voting App and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Need to restrict access to a couple of the poll API calls. Accomplished this by adding a authCheck function to the necessary routes. Have been using the Postman App to debug these API calls. Ran into a nasty error when I corrupted the AuthToken cookie. Needed to put in a try catch block to avoid have the express server blow up and send the wrong thing.

The daily programming challenge was to accept a number and then return the nearest prime numbers. In the case that someone passes in a prime number, just return 'prime'. Did a quick scan of StackOverflow to find a small function to determine if a number is prime. From there I wrote the functions that would find the prime below and above the number given. This was a brute force method to check every number until a prime was found. I put in some bounds like sqrt and square of the number. In truth, those bounds are not important as the function will return a value before the loop reaches the bounds.

### Day 63, Aug 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** New API call to create polls for the Voting App and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Worked on the newpoll api for creating polls. Had to do some research into how express would handle array data from the HTML Post. With a few tests via the Postman app, I set about using the Poll schema object. Made some minor changes to the schema. Ran into some problem with my authCheck function. Made a bad assumption that using the next callback function would stop any other code in authCheck from running. Not true and ending up sending multiple responses back. Moved the failed response into the catch section so it only runs when the token is corrupted.

The daily programming challenge was to find the nearest number to a square root with the precision passed in as an argument. Used a Math.pow() on the precision to give me an exponent to multiple the square root by before I truncated the number and then divided by the exponent.

### Day 64, Aug 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** New API calls to create polls for the Voting App.

**Thoughts:** Worked on the get poll and delete poll API calls. The get poll call was similar to the user login call. Just stripped out the code to check the password before sending the object. Didn't like some of the low level properties that mongo puts on the object. So I added a toClient() function to the poll object that would remove those properties. This way the client app gets a sanitized object to work with.

I implemented a delete call, but as I'm writing this log, I didn't put in enough security checks. I have the initial authCheck to see if the user is logged in. This check doesn't prevent the user from deleting the wrong array. Off the top of my head, may need to add another parameter given to the remove() function so that we pass in the auth email. This should prevent a non owner from deleting a poll. Otherwise I'll have to pull the document out of Mongo and check if the user is the owner. Work for tomorrow.

### Day 65, Aug 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixed the delete poll API for the Voting App.

**Thoughts:** What exactly is a CommandResult? Trying to use promises on all the Mongoose Schema calls. The promise from the remove() function is a CommandResult and I can't seem to find the docs to tell me what I should be looking at. Dumping it out via console.log(). Looks like I need to check CommandResult.result.n to see how many documents are removed. By checking this I can tell inform the user the correct result of their request. With these changes, I believe the deletePoll API should be finished.

Also worked on the recordPollVote. Copied the getPoll function to start with and then added in the code to update the document. I ran with a .map() to go over the choices and find the one the user selected. I think I could have just used the choice parameter to acess the choies array element, but wanted to verify that the element's id matched the choice.

### Day 66, Aug 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Created the addPollChoice API call for the Voting App and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Worked on the addPollChoice. Cribbed from the recordPollVote and replaced the vote update with the new choice update. This mostly consisted of a reduce to find the highest choice id and then a push of the new choice object.

The daily programming challenge was to download a list of words from a URL and count words of a certain size. My solution was a combination of an answer found on StackOverflow and the Node.js docs for http.get(). Just concatenated on the 'data' calls and waited till the 'end' call to do the work. Took all the data and split it into a word array. Setup a size array to handle the min and max sizes that I wanted to group and used that to filter the word list. What was left would give me the count I needed.

### Day 67, Aug 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Ran through Codecademy's Learn ReactJS: Part I and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Received an email that the React course on Codecademy has received an update because things are being depreciated. I ran into a bit of this when I was trying to do some of my freeCodeCamp projects. Mostly understand moving the components to ES6 classes. So I decided to go through the course again before I start writing the React front end to the voting app.

The daily programming challenge built off of yesterday's challenge. So I was able to recycle a bit of code and then focus on getting the solution. Since that was pretty easy, I then looked into a way to handle the http.get response via a promise. Cribbed a function from an blog article I found. Then I copied the code that did the real work into a function. This function was called from in the then() portion of the promise. While this code all works, I'm not sure how I passed back the final data from inside the promise. :/

### Day 68, Aug 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started Codecademy's Learn ReactJS: Part II and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** More of Codecademy's ReactJS courses. Learning about stateful and stateless components. Not so sure about the updating siblings pattern. I just think about it as the parent/child pattern. You just have multiple child components that are stateless and use the same props from the parent.

The daily programming challenge built off of yesterday's challenge. Reusing a lot of the same based code for this week challenges. Thus I replaced the filterWords function with the requirements of the challenge. Made a big conditional that matched word length or matched word length plus one and begins with the same 2 letters.

**Today's Progress:** Finished Codecademy's Learn ReactJS: Part II and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** It's to late to journal. Finished the Codecademy course.

The daily programming challenge built off of yesterday's challenge. Similar challenge where I need to filter on word size or word size plus 1. The new part to the challenge was that the words needed to be sorted. The sort with a bit involved since we have to figure out the letter frequency in the word list and then sort based off of a frequency score.

### Day 70, Aug 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Using the Free Weekend at Code School to learn Elixir and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Completed the "Try Elixir" course. Turns out it was already free. Still want to use semicolon to finish a line of code.

The daily programming challenge built off of the other challenge of the week. Given a word, find the best suggestions from the word list. I came up with 3 criteria to filter the word list. Has to start with the same letter. Needs to have about half of the letters in common with the original word. Word length needs to be about the same. With this filtered set of words, I then used the letter frequency sort to find the best three suggestions.

**Today's Progress:** Using the Free Weekend at Code School to learn Elixir and some BootStrap.

**Thoughts:** Finished up the last 2 sections of "Mixing It Up With Elixir" course. Elixir seems a bit structured, not sure how to do quick little scripts without making whole project. Also ran through the "Blasting Off with Bootstrap" course. Mostly a refresher on Bootstrap v3.

### Day 73, Aug 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Created the getPolls API call for the Voting App

**Thoughts:** Back to work on the Voting App API after doing some courses at Codecademy and Code School. Did some searching to see how to make parameters optional. After I saw a comment about REST API conventions, I ditched the optional parameters thoughts and standardized the calls. Also saw a link to the mongoose-pagination module, which seemed like something useful. Added that plugin to the Poll schema and then used it in the getPolls. With the getPolls API call done, the API should be complete until the React based client starts using it.

### Day 74, Aug 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Mostly documenting the Voting App and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Getting the docs updated to reflect the recent changes to the API for the Voting App. Also worked a bit with Postman to get all the test calls saved.

The daily programming challenge was to test if a number given would be cubes to make a building. The problem was worded along the lines of N^3 ... 1^3. But for the solution it made more sense to go 1^3 ... N^3. Where N is the answer we need to return. Since I just completed the Elixir courses at Code School, I use the language to solve the problem. I think my Elixir code was ok, wasn't sure if I was using to many variables. Biggest problem was running it. IO.Puts is not the same as IO.puts. In fact, IO.Puts doesn't exist and causes my run statement to throw an error.

### Day 75, Aug 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Elixir kicked my butt. Grant I just started with the language, but I'm so not used to the storage of data. I was able to work on getting the user input for the rectangles and parse the information into a plain list. At this point my knowledge of Elixir was at it's limit and searching didn't give me any good answers. Having spent an hour to get this far and not seeing a light at the end of the tunnel, I fell back to Javascript.

Quick find/grep through some older daily programming tasks, I got a refresher on using readline to get user input. Got working code pretty quickly and then realized that logic was wrong. Originally, I was trying to keep the rectangle points together. After some quick sketching on paper, I got a handle on the geometry. Got all the right points extracted into a new triangle that I could calculate the area of. Took a lot longer than I expected.

### Day 76, Aug 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Developer paralysis on Voting App and Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Trying to figure out how I should start the react portion of the Voting app.

The daily programing wasn't as tricky today, doing anagrams again. Didn't really check any old challenges to figure this one out. Basically go lowercase, strip out spaces, split, sort, join and compare. Since the validation require the original phrases to be output all work had to be stored in new variables. Personally, would have had the function return a boolean instead of a sentence.

### Day XX, Aug 25, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Didn't really finish my hour of code for the day. I did work on the daily programming challenge. Need to find the alliterative words in a sentence. Used a regex strip out the period and commas. To minimize after the reduce code, I added a termination string to the sentence. Inside the reduce, the code checks if the first letter matches and puts on an array. If it doesn't match then save the set if we have 2 elements. Also reset the array with the current word.

### Day 77, Aug 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started login component for Voting App and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Starting to get back to working on the Voting App. Getting back to the front end and working on a Login compoent. Ran into some issues with getting the input working.

The daily programming challenge was to test a latin square. Two parameters passed in the size of the square and the data to fill it. Made a array of the size and gave it a default value so the map function will work. The map was to take slices of the data so I ended up with a 2d array. I then tested the rows by sorting them and making sure we had unique numbers that are less than the size. Transposed the square so I could just run the columns through the same test as the rows. The column and row tests were concatenated together and reduced to a single boolean.

### Day XX, Aug 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Given a set of coordinates, how many moves would it take a knight to get there from 0,0. Failed in my attempt to use recursion, fell back to using a while loop. This made it more of a breath first search. To cut down on number of spots to check I JSON encoded the points and put them in a Set and then converted the Set back to an array.

It seemed like you could do this problem recursively. Maybe if I had a global variable to keep track of what I’ve tested it would have worked that way.

## Day 78, Aug 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Taking a normal math equation and converting it to RPN. At first I tried to see if I could get regex to handle it, but that was a dead end. Ending up looking at some Java code so I could see what I needed to do in JS. So I needed two stacks, one to hold the output and the other to hold the operators we need to use later. So numbers always go on the output stack. Push only the previous operator if present onto output. If inside parentheses, push all operators until left parentheses.

### Day XX, Aug 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Solving RPN is a lot easier than converting to it. Put numbers on the stack. When an operator is reached, pop off 2 values from the stack. These values get saved into variables since order is important, you can't just pop them off into the operation. The challenge require the support of the factorial operator. Unlike all other operations, factorial only requires 1 number off the stack. So I push the variable I didn't need back on the stack before pushing the factorial. I was concerned then this might break the JS if the first operation was a factorial. Wasn't sure how pushing a null value onto the stack would affect the array. Test case show it wasn't a problem.

### Day 79, Sep 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Trying to add react-router-dom to Voting App and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Some days I feel like React is a bit like Backbone. It gets you started, then you need to find other libraries that cover what it doesn't handle. The login example I was following got to confusing on how it handles state. This led me to install react-router-dom to get some stucture to the app. This end up with a `A <Router> may have only one child element` error that I'm not sure how to fix.

The daily programming challenge was to identify and convert hex numbers to decimal. We had done something like this in the past, but I didn't bother to look for it until I had a working solution. I went with some regex to identify a hex number and convert it. I was using Number() to make the conversion. This requires that the hex number starts with `0x`, so I added another replace before the replace conversion to make sure the hex number is properly formatted. Looking back I found that I had used `parseInt(n, 16)` to make the conversion.

### Day 80, Sep 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started getting my React Component talking to the API and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Play catch up with my log, this entry is a little late. Fixed my problem (`A <Router> may have only one child element`) with the React Router. Looks like I need to add a `Switch` element around the `Route` elements. I swear that was not in the simple example I saw on the website the first time I started doing this. Started on getting the Client code to login into the API.

Using the fetch call to log the user in, this will cause compatibility problems with older browsers. May think about a polyfill at a later, if it is a real issue. The API doesn’t seem to like how the data is sent and always get back a 403 error. Don't seem to have a problem when using Postman to test the API call. Will figure this out later.

The daily programming task was to test if a word is in alphabetical order. The first pass at this was to split the word into an array and test all the letters. This was all in a reduce that returned an object about the words order (ie alphabetical or reverse). After seeing some other solutions I realized that I just need to compare the transformed word with itself.

### Day 81, Sep 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** This seems similar to one we've attempted before. I can calculate the zig zag sequence for a given array. What I have a problem with is dropping elements to see if the sequence size will increase.  I tried to use recursion to drop an element, but it takes to long to calculate.

### Day 82, Sep 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixing API call from client and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Working on why the client code keeps getting a 403 error when trying to use the Login API. Did some searching to find an answer. Ended up on StackOverflow and found a [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29775797/fetch-post-json-data) that matched up with my problem. I wasn't really doing anything with my headers. Turns out that I wasn't setting the Content-Type and thus not letting the Express.js app know that it needs to parse the body of the request. Only two lines of code changed, but it took me a while to debug a solution.

After the beat down I received from the daily programming challenge, today's challenge was much easier to work out. Given an array of numbers return an array of the prime numbers that are factors. To do this I calculated all the prime numbers less that the max number given. These prime numbers are tested as factors of given numbers. The array of prime factors has duplicates so they need to be filtered out.

### Day 83, Sep 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Minor tweak on the Voting app and daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Daily programming challenge was to group words that are anagrams of one another. Other people using other languages were able to get to one liner. I couldn't do that with Javascript. I have to make three passes over the data. Once to figure out what the keys are. A second pass to group word based off of their key. Finally the third pass converts the storage object into the required array. I could cut out one of the passes, but then I need to add an if/else statement.
