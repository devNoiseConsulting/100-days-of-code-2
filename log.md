# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 17, 2017 - May 29, 2017

**Thoughts:** Most weekdays the #daily_programmer channel on the PhillyDev Slack will post programming challenges. This was/is a good way to keep using my programming skills.

### Day 1: May 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Getting a new repo setup for my second 100 Days of Code Challenge.

**Thoughts:** Going for a second repo that isn't a fork. This will help populate my contributions counter on Github. Gaming the system. Getting the repo setup for freeCodeCamp's Roguelike Dungeon Crawler.

### Day 2: May 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Getting a rough initialization of the dungeon. Daily programming challenges from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Trying to stub out a basic dungeon. Run into a problem with Array().fill() when creating a 2D array. The fill only makes one array so any changes to a cell show up in every row.
Also React wants me to start using ES6 Classes to define my components. Not having much luck with that and back out those changes for todays commit.

Gave the daily programming challenge the usual old school and ES6 solutions. I wasn't able to really cut the code down to much with the Array methods. Attempts at just using Array methods seemed to head in the direction of O(n^2) so I stop going down that path.

### Day 3: Jun 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Roguelike dungeon has movement and some improved rendering. Daily programming challenges from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Felt like the rendering was taking a bit since the initial code had the 10,000 dungeon cells being rendered. Move to having the dungeon row display all the cells, brings us down to 100 components to render. Put in a keypress handler to determine movement and update the dungeon. Once that seemed to work I added a check to make sure the cell was empty.

Daily programming challenge went well for the first solution. Had a couple iterations to get it right. Had to make checks against both the pattern and the string. Tried to get fancy and have my code generate regex expressions based on the pattern. It worked in general, but failed one of the test cases. Ran out of time to work on it, but the solution seems to be added another check that compares the length of the unique elements in the two arrays.

### Day 4: Jun 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Roguelike dungeon has treasure and monsters. Daily programming challenges from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Added a some CSS so the dungeon's font size would be smaller to fit more onto the screen, Refactored the dungeon initialization to break out the parts into their own function to help keep the code clear. Also changed the values in the cells from being a character to being an object. This allows me to have a better handle on the state of things in the dungeon.

Only went with one solution for the Daily programming challenge. Made use of Array.reduce() to store the duplicates. Array.reduce() is getting to be a familiar tool. The Array.indexOf() was the one had me using a feature rarely used by me. Passed in an offset argument so the Array.indexOf() would ignore the first instance of the occurrence.

### Day 5: Jun 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Roguelike dungeon has treasure collection and monster fighting.

**Thoughts:** Making progress. Added the code to collect the treasure and add health back to the player. Player will now attack monsters and take their weapon when defeated. Used react-bootstrap to clean up the UI. Also added a function to determine if a dungeon cell was visible from the player's current position.

### Day 6: Jun 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Roguelike dungeon has multiple levels now.

**Thoughts:** Reworking the code to handle the generation of a new level when the player enters the ladder cell. Getting an off by one bug for the dungeon level in the state object. Must be a race condition as my code is executing before the state is updated. Updating the user's level doesn't seem to be working, will look into that tomorrow.

### Day 7: Jun 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixing game logic for Roguelike dungeon. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Fix Level bug because I was doing an exact comparison when I should have been doing a greater than comparison. Added code to make sure the player's health doesn’t go above 100. Added a dungeonWon state that will indicate the player has won and display all of the dungeon level.

I passed all the test cases for the daily programming challenge, but I think I missing some use cases. I believe my code is only returning results for a subsequence of 3. I should have handled cases that are larger.

### Day 8: Jun 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixing game state for Roguelike dungeon. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Working on getting the Reset/New Game and Continue buttons to work. Booleans are not strings and that screwed up disabling the Continue button. The React component's state is not your friend when you're trying to it to calculate based off of intermediate values. I ended up reworking how the dungeon is initialized so that state is accessed as little as possible. This means I refactored a bit of the hacks I put in and instead just passed in what I considered to be the current state for the sub functions.

I love working with array. So I made everything in the daily programming challenge into an array to solve the problem. This allowed me to make the prefixes pretty easy. I'm sure that the solution would be pretty much the same if I had used String.substring().

### Day 9: Jun 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Figuring out my React render problem for the Roguelike dungeon. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** The UI for my Rouguelike game is still text based. Though I have finally figured out how to get my array rendered. Previously, React wouldn't like the code I put into the render function or it turned the code into a string and wasn't valid HTML. Not sure why I thought I needed to use Array.join() to get the JSX/HTML.

I cribbed my daily programming solution from the Game of Life project I did for freeCodeCamp. Since I only had to write the function to calculate the cell life given the parameters. This allowed me to simplify how I got the total number of living neighbors. I did this using Array.reduce, but could have done it using Array.filter.

### Day 10: Jun 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Gave the Roguelike dungeon a graphical dungeon. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Probably not using as much Sass as I should be, but keeping the UI pretty basic. Almost as much play testing as coding tonight. Decided that I need to be able to distinguish between the regular monsters and the boss monster. Mostly just minor changes to the code to get the pixel cells to work, and then handling the boss display.

The daily programming challenge was pretty easy today. Made use of the ES6 spread operator because of how the problem was worded. The function was to take an unlimited number of parameters. The split was that the first parameter was the offset and the other parameters could just go into an array. Made a revised solution after seeing another solution. It made me realize that a simple change would allow me to access the value I needed with the use of String.substring().

### Day 11: Jun 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Not much. Started working on random generation of the rooms for the Roguelike dungeon. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** A little bit of refactoring. Wanted to put all of the dungeon cell definitions all together. Started work on the generating rooms with the initializeRooms function. Not liking the direction I took and research into how to implementations are leading towards a binary tree setup.

Had to refresh my memory for the daily programming challenge. I generally don't do user input in my node.js code. Made use of the ES6 string template, which is much nicer than the usual piece a string together with the desired variable.

### Day 12: Jun 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Refactoring the game logic for the Roguelike dungeon.

**Thoughts:** Avoiding the room generation today and went with refactoring. Started with moving all the dungeon creation to the DungeonFactory. That was straight forward with the changes I did the other day. Next I move into making the game play function work with the currentState. This took a couple iterations as I tried to avoid breaking the game as much as possible. This lead to pulling data out of currentState as well a putting data back in. Then I worked on having the game play function return the currentState variable. At which point they could be moved into the DungeonFactory.

### Day 13: Jun 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Starting random room generation for Roguelike dungeon.

**Thoughts:** Looking into BSP trees for creating the rooms for the dungeon. Started an implementation that seems good so far. Going forward, I need to think about how to calculate the placement of the door between rooms. At that point, I should be ready to draw the walls.

The daily programming challenge was a simple guess the number game. Had to review how I get node to do input via the readline module.

### Day 14: Jun 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I finished my Roguelike Dungeon Crawler! Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** This project seems to complicated to develop in CodePen, so I developed it on my laptop in a simple react/webpack project. The UI is very simple with bootstrap and some colored span/pixels. It took time to get everything done, but I really had to do a deep dive into figuring out how to generate the dungeon rooms. Found some articles on BSP trees to create a map. Wrote my own tree class based off of the sample code I saw. I decided to keep the room full sized and have door ways instead of rooms that fit in the rectangle with connecting hallways.

While I'm calling it done, there are 2 things I may come back to:

-   React.createClass is being depreciated. I need to go back and convert my components into ES6 classes.
-   It would be nice to make the dungeon larger. That would require me to splice the dungeon area down to a visible area that would be rendered.

The daily programming challenge was similar to yesterdays, but you had to guess the name. Had to tweak the logic to help the user guess again.

### Day 15: Jun 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixing door placement and starting component to class conversion for the Roguelike Dungeon Crawler. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Adding some randomization to the door placement so there is some variation moving between rooms. My orientation is a little off, had some errors where we went outside the dungeon bounds. Also started to work on getting the React components converted over to ES6 classes us jscodeshift. Trying to avoid pulling in the create-react-class module. Not sure if I'm running into a babel config setting, but it didn't like most of the converted classes. Removed the arrow function with plain functions and just commented out the empty state object.

The daily programming challenge was a straight forward task using regex. Even made a bash one liner for it.

### Day 16: Jun 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Codecademy code challenge. Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** Using my Javascript skills to get the Codecademy challenge done. Using reduce to get the products. Had to remember to try pairs of negative numbers to get the maximum product.

The PhillyDev daily programming challenge had you pad the words with 'x' to be the same length as the longest word. Also had to switch the first 'x' with a 'z' if the last letter of the word was 'x'.

### Day 17: Jun 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** The simple programming challenge dragged me down a rabbit hole today. Basically repeat the challenge from yesterday, but transpose the word block. I took the quick way out and found an [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36164530) on Stack Overflow for how to transpose a 2d array. I get how to transpose a matrix array and could have written my own code. Took the easy way out as I wanted the challenge done so I could do some analog stuff today with my son. When I get back to looking at my code, I want to understand exactly what the code I copied it doing. The code is getting expanded/converted so I can debug how the transpose is working.

### Day 18: Jun 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Daily programming challenge from the PhillyDev Slack.

**Thoughts:** The daily programming theme this week seemed to be 2D arrays or matrix structures. Today's challenge was to take a list of words and make a word find. Got some [notes](http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/creating-word-find-pzzules-in-C-Sharp-and-gdi/
) for a C# implementation. This gave me the foundation for the work I needed to do in Javascript, but I still needed to come up with the lower level functionality. When I called the placeWord function, I needed to make sure I made a copy to the sub-array otherwise I end up trashing the word find. Lots of debugging/testing to get this to work.

### Day 19: Jun 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** No progress, but trying to convert React Component to ES6 class.

**Thoughts:** Trying to follow a couple articles on how to convert a React Component to an ES6 class. For some reason `state = {...};` ends up giving a `Module build failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token` error. Now sure what is causing this and trying searching for a solution. Through it might get solves by adding es2015 presets to babel.

<!--

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress** Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
