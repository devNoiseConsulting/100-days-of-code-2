## Doing It Again??

So I completed my [100 Days of Code Challenge](https://github.com/devNoiseConsulting/100-days-of-code) and took it easy for a while.
I started doing some more [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) projects, but wasn't consistently working on them. So I'm starting up another log to help keep me focused.

## Goals

-   Continue to work on the daily challenges that the PhillyDev Slack #daily_programmer present.
-   Complete freeCodeCamp's Data Visualization Certification.
-   Complete freeCodeCamp's Back End Development Certification.
    -   This is a stretch goal.
    -   I've completed the challenges and need to work on the projects. The estimated time for these projects could fill up a 100 Days of Code challenge by themselves.
